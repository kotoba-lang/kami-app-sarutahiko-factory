(ns kotoba.sarutahiko-factory.fixtures
  "JVM resource loader for this repo's synthetic sarutahiko-factory EDN
  fixtures (`resources/kotoba/sarutahiko-factory/*.edn`).

  The real upstream scene dataset
  (`70-tools/e7m-sim/scenes/sarutahiko-factory-r0/{factory.scene,
  construction.order, clashes, robots, production.order}.json`, referenced
  by the original Rust crate's `include_str!`) is **not present anywhere
  in this monorepo checkout** — confirmed absent by a broad search before
  this port began. Rather than fabricate that dataset, this repo ships
  small hand-authored EDN fixtures under `resources/kotoba/sarutahiko-
  factory/` exercising the same shape of properties the original Rust
  tests checked, and this namespace is the only I/O in the repo: a thin
  `clojure.java.io/resource` + `clojure.edn/read-string` loader, mirroring
  `kotoba-lang/kami-scene-contracts`'s I/O-loader namespaces. Plain
  `.clj` (JVM classpath resources only) rather than `.cljc` — there is
  nothing to bundle a browser-side loader for yet, and every other
  namespace in this repo (the actual domain contract) is `.cljc` and has
  no I/O.

  As of the Datomic/Datascript-queryable EDN refactor, each fixture file on
  disk is a `[{:db/id -1 :factory/... ...}]` tx-data vector (ready to hand
  to `(d/transact conn ...)` as-is) rather than a bare map — non-scalar
  values (nested maps / vectors-of-maps) are stored pr-str'd as string
  \"blob\" attributes. `load-edn` here unwraps that back into the plain,
  un-blobbed map the rest of this repo's domain code
  (`kotoba.sarutahiko-factory.factory` et al.) and tests already expect,
  so every existing call site keeps working unchanged. Top-level attribute
  keys were already idiomatically namespaced per file (`:factory/*`,
  `:robots/*`, ...) before this refactor, so they are kept as-is (not
  re-namespaced)."

(ns kotoba.sarutahiko-factory.construction-order
  "4D construction order — ported from `scene.rs`'s `ConstructionOrder` /
  `OrderStep` and the `programme_days` method. Drives the giemon-factory
  4D-BIM 'reveal elements in `:seq` order' playback pattern
  (ADR-2606010030); the WASM playback loop itself
  (`run_sarutahiko_factory_build_v1`, clock/reveal-timer/HUD bridge) is
  unported host-adapter code.

  An `order` is a plain EDN map:

    :construction-order/of     string (subject factory name)
    :construction-order/steps  [{:step/seq :step/id :step/name :step/trade
                                  :step/robot :step/zone :step/duration-d
                                  :step/reveals [element-id ...]} ...]

  Pure: no I/O. See `kotoba.sarutahiko-factory.fixtures/construction-order`
  for this repo's synthetic test fixture."
